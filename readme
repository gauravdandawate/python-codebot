Python CodeBot
==============

A local-first, codebase-aware chatbot for Python repositories. Powered by LangChain, AST, Groq, FastAPI, and Streamlit, it understands your codebase and answers queries with relevant class/function/annotation references and code snippets.

Features
--------

- Embeds your codebase using AST metadata
- Answers questions intelligently with relevant context
- Displays code snippets with file references
- Streamlit-based UI for easy interaction
- FastAPI backend with endpoints for embedding and querying



Installation
------------

1. Clone the Repo

   git clone https://github.com/gauravdandawate/python-codebot.git
   cd python-codebot

2. Create a Virtual Environment

   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies

   pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Application
-----------------------

1. Start FastAPI Server

   uvicorn main:app --reload

2. Launch Streamlit UI 

   streamlit run app_ui.py

Generating Embeddings
---------------------

Embed your codebase before querying:

From Streamlit UI:
- Click "Generate Embeddings" and enter path (e.g., `codebase/`)

Or using API:

   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/embed \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"codebase_path": "codebase/"}'

Example Queries
---------------

- What APIs are defined in `main.py`?
- What does the class `UserManager` do?
- List all decorators in the project.
- How many functions are defined in `utils.py`?

How it Works
------------

- Uses Python AST to extract classes, functions, annotations
- Stores metadata with each embedded chunk
- FAISS used as vector store for retrieval
- LangChain formats and answers queries
- Code snippets shown via Streamlit

Re-embedding
------------

To start fresh with new embeddings:

   rm -rf index_store/
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/embed \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"codebase_path": "codebase/"}'

Requirements
------------

- Python 3.10+
- Groq API key (free version is sufficent)
